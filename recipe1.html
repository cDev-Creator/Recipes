    <h4 class="center cursive"> The Boil:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Add the water, salt, crab boil seasoning bag, lemon quarters,
        and onion quarters to a very large pot. I use a 20-quart pot.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the corn and potatoes into the pot. Be super careful so you don't
        splash boiling water on yourself.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot back to a boil. This takes 5-10 minutes. Boil for about 8-12 minutes
        or until the potatoes are almost fork-tender.</li>
        <li>Add in the broccoli and green beans. Continue to boil until all veggies are tender.</li>
        <li>Drain the pot carefully into a large colander.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4 class="center cursive">Cajun Butter Sauce:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the vegan butter on low-medium heat.
        Add in the garlic powder, onion powder, Old Bay seasoning, paprika, and Cajun seasoning.</li>
        <li>Let the butter come to a simmer for about 1 minute, whisking to make sure it doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer again and then remove from the heat. Stir in the lemon juice.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4 class="center cursive">The Sausage and Shrimp:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the sausage links lengthwise, then into thirds or quarters.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add in the sausage and saute until browned.</li>
        <li>Saute the BeLeaf shrimp accorning to cooking directiosn after the sausage is finished.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4 class="center cursive">Serving Time!</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>You can leave the strained veggies right in the colander, or serve them on a large serving dish with tongs to easily grab the veggies.</li>
        <li>Add the veggies to your plate along with the vegan sausage. Drizzle the Cajun butter sauce over top. Dig in!</li>
